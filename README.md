# factorio-starcraft
A mod that brings a 1:1 Starcraft simulation to Factorio.

Note: This mod only includes Starcraft's units and behaviours, it does not allow you to control them and there is no plan to.

## V1 Target
v1 will **include**:
- SFX
- Units/structures and their Flingy -> Sprite -> Image relationships
- IScript (image script)
- Orders
- Weapons
- Creep
- Pylon power
- Unit special abilities (cloak, burrow, siege, etc)
- Powerups and Special Buildings
- Basic AI behaviours (unit responses and worker harvesting)
- Names (+Translations)
- Multiplayer
- Setup tool (to pull data from Starcraft: Remastered)

This will not release without all of the above.

v1 will **exclude** the following:
- What/Piss/Yes SFX
- Title demos
- Doodads
- Terrain
- Portraits
- Supply
- Ore/Gas tracking and costs
- Unit/Structure requirements
- Scores (kills, deaths, etc)
- Upgrades (no upgrades for now)
- Technologies (they will be automatically researched for now)
- Advisor alerts (i.e. nuclear launch detected)

## V2 Target
v2 will likely include most of what v1 is excluding.

## Important
While some things may be implemented later, this mod will **never** include the following:

- Assets without the setup tool (the setup tool will **always** be required)
- Music replacements
- Maps/triggers
- Unit control
- Special menus, buttons, or displays (i.e. action card, HUD, Starcraft-themed menu, ore/gas/supply display -- not happening)
- Fonts
- Game types or win conditions
- The ability to hold any Starcraft units (besides powerups) in your inventory
- Any major changes to the original Starcraft unit mechanics.
